## About

I’m **Kyle (Yilin) Gao**, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Systems Design Engineering at the **University of Waterloo**. I completed my PhD in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo in May 2025. I have a background in mathematical physics from my undergraduate and master’s studies.
My research lies at the intersection of **GeoAI**, **remote sensing**, and **3D reconstruction**, where I explore how Gaussian Splatting and large language models can enhance spatial understanding and environmental monitoring.  

I’ve authored and co-authored over **fourty one peer-reviewed papers (eight first-authorships)**, including publications in *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing* and the *ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing*.
My current work focuses on building **intelligent, multimodal systems for remote sensing** that integrate geospatial data, visual analysis, and language for applications in both urban digital twins and environmental management.

## Recent Highlights
