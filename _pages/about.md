## About

I’m **Kyle (Yilin) Gao**, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Systems Design Engineering at the **University of Waterloo**.  
My research lies at the intersection of **GeoAI**, **remote sensing**, and **3D reconstruction**, where I explore how large language models can enhance spatial understanding and environmental monitoring.  

I’ve authored and co-authored over **thirty-seven peer-reviewed papers**, including publications in *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing* and the *ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing*.
My current work focuses on building **intelligent, multimodal systems for remote sensing** that integrate geospatial data, visual analysis, and language for applications in both urban digital twins and environmental management.

## Recent Highlights
